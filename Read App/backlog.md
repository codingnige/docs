### Lounge

 On the subject of Sports, and particularly touching Soccer, there are attractive " Top Ten Categories/Personalities" programs on-going on Social media, and in mainstream broadcasting/media. The BBC runs one on " Match of The Day" to fill in the void from lack of premiere league football, and is very popular now. It continues on Social Media (Twitter, FB etc) .

We can adopt a similar in our Lounge area, to draw discussions/opinions and debates, which will then lead to sponsored Lounges by the personalities to engage with their followers. This will be a paid for service, and the same rules of engagement will apply.

I suggest we have a Lounge which has  the " Top 10 Footballers" from each Continent. I suppose with lack of activities, a lot of celebrities are welcoming such inclusion. Data is easily available and can be followed in syndication.
