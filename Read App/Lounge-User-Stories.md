# Description of lounge user stories

● There are 4 collage boxes when you get into the lounge

○ Continue reading should be what the user is actively reading in the lounge,
however if a new user comes to the lounge, It should state “start reading”, if the
reader clicks on it then it should redirect to the exclusive content

○ EXclusive content - This is the lounge owner’s materials, not someone else’s
publication it could house paid and non paid resources

○ LIbrary - should be resources that the lounge owner has picked from other
sources that have been deemed appropriate for the lounge. I will suggest in the
phase A, that we should have at least 5 lounges that we create .
○ The final collage is any image and a short message

I would suggest to have at least 5 lounges that we create to illustrate how this should be applied
to make it clear. Food, Sports, Comics, News, KIds lounge (books), Faith , Fashion, Wellness
