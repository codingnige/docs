## Lounge Plan Connectivity


### Wireframes

### User stories:

Lounge (going to use Lucy’s as a user story example)

#### 1

• Firstly, after joining a lounge, the sign should show Joined rather than leave.
Joined should be in blue not red. The red is too obvious as if prompting the user
to leave. Also leave could mean temporarily leave the group and browse other
lounges or leave completely. So for avoidance – keep as joined and we should
put the leave lounge hidden – either double tap the joined button and then leave
option comes, and ask the user if they want to leave , always add a confirm of
any negative actions such as delete, remove or leave, before the action is made.


• Where it shows 3 users have joined, you want to be able to see a list of the users
in the lounge because that way you can connect as friends or add to a group
plan. In the window where you see others that have joined also, we should have
a small button that has invite that way a lounge owner / other users can invite
others – the add friends window should pop up,we need to start linking the
actions. A lounge owner and all users In the lounge need to be able to invite


• I think the background has to be a lot whiter across the app, not white but the
lightest shade of grey– it is still too grey, there is also meant to be small line that
runs across to separate the intro area and 4 box collage (see style by stano)


• Can we change for the welcome message in the 4 box collage to be at the top
and swap with continue reading.. As these lounges are being used for a
prototype / demo to others we need a picture that has a good contrast with the
welcome message – its difficult to read the message – please use the same style
guide as stanos – welcome message in small fonts, quote marks etc.


• There is too much spacing between the Headers ie continue reading and the text
below, reduce the spacing a bit


• Exclusive Content – should be in the same font size and in bold. We should have
content here, so can we remove the words not yet to come... remember this is
being used as a demo to show to external contacts, it needs to look really
attractive. Every lounge owner at the early stage must have their content, as
least for our demo.


• Library – again pls use Stano’s style guide . It cant be free text, it should say
Lucy’s library and then the same words enjoy access to other books and blogs.
Please use font size, colour, right spacing etc

Now I want to address the interface between the lounge and group plans:


• The lounge exclusive content must have at a minimum of one content – in our
case Lucy has 5.


• The library must have a minimum of 1 source of content


• The user story is that they can access either exclusive content or library to pick a
content that they want to read. In lucy’s example, I clicked in the farm. When I
pick this book, it shows read … and add to my library. At this point the
wireframes should kick in, it should say create a private reading plan or create a
group reading plan (refer to create group reading plan wireframes, request to join
plans, plan details and how to leave group plans) or even join an existing group -
I think all these actions are missing.


• This connects the books in the library to a plan , which then shows at the bottom
– where we see plans. They are connected


• Now within the plans, when I click on it, it says second test plan don’t know what
that means???? When you refer to the wireframes, the owner of the group can
name the group plan , in this scenario I have suggested “healthy vegans”.


• When I click on the book, it takes me to plan details . I Like that the continue or
hide blocks the activity and comments.


• When I click hide and therefore to display the activity, I get to see if a user
highlights , comments etc. but I can also see two books in the plan details even
though I clicked on a book to start with. To simplify we need an activity to match
each unique content, otherwise you get lost... so you need to have one activity
per content.


• Rather I think what was intended here in the space was the chats … this was
where the chats were meant to sit (please refer to the wireframes). We need to
move it from where it currently is.


• When I then move from plan details to clicking the book, I can see reviews and I
think this is where you should have your activity showing highlights and
comments that relate to a book. So again its about moving the location of this
functionality.


• When I click on read – the book opens up, as I start to read there are two types
of comments – the comment at the top bar is what should feed your activity /
which acts as a review of the book . Rename that icon from comments o review.


• The comment at the bottom is to comment on a highlighted text, this makes
sense, which is perfect but you must create a comments wall that other users ca
see, this should feed your activity wall.
We need to discuss the user stories for blogs and news today so I can understand the
user experience, as these will be light touch and not as extensive as the books

## Description of lounge user stories

● There are 4 collage boxes when you get into the lounge

○ Continue reading should be what the user is actively reading in the lounge,
however if a new user comes to the lounge, It should state “start reading”, if the
reader clicks on it then it should redirect to the exclusive content

○ EXclusive content - This is the lounge owner’s materials, not someone else’s
publication it could house paid and non paid resources

○ LIbrary - should be resources that the lounge owner has picked from other
sources that have been deemed appropriate for the lounge. I will suggest in the
phase A, that we should have at least 5 lounges that we create .
○ The final collage is any image and a short message

I would suggest to have at least 5 lounges that we create to illustrate how this should be applied
to make it clear. Food, Sports, Comics, News, KIds lounge (books), Faith , Fashion, Wellness
