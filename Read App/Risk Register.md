3. As we approach external user testing with segmentation, any further releases must allow a complete end to end user experience as demanded by vision of the application. As an example, after a successful registration of a profile in the "Friends" section, one should be able to invite other friends, read book etc.
4. In line with GDPR, GDPR-K(sub-section for children)/COPPA in addressing Cybersecurity and data protection, we should be implementing a Parental Verification (PV) security model. This will be an option where parents will approve to their children engagement with the app. Parents will have to ensure they provide their email addresses or Credit Card to the ReadApp as verification where their children will be involved. This will complete the registration and acceptance of any child to use the app where applicable.
5.  In line with securing the personal data which is supplied by users, we will be looking at enhancing encryption with Homomorphic Algorithm to allow "SEARCHABLE Encryption". I will pick this up separately with you, as is a Crypto algorithm pattern of Cybersecurity.
6. The ReadApp will have to comply to "Architecting for High Availability" to guarantee improved Scaling, Resilience, Spikes and also limit resources when not needed: Mitigate and restore automatically points of failure, Provide Multiple Availability Zones (MAZ - Apps availability must be engineered to support geographical disasters to servers), Self Healing (Cloud Watch policies for CPU and network usage), and Loose Coupling. Can we confirm if Digital Ocean provides all these features.
7. The ReadApp will provide Safe Filters and  multiple (Linked) log in accounts for example - supporting the PV (Parental verification). A parent can be an administrator, and at the same time have an account to be used for PV where they have children . This will be done partly with collaboration of certified external agencies.
8. I have identified some third parties we will be collaborating with to achieve some aspects that I have mentioned above.
