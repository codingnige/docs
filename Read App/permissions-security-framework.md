# Permissions and Security Framework Document

## Lounge and Plans

### Permissions and security 


1. There will be a mix of people on any social media platform and its our responsibility to ensure there isnt online grooming and as much as possible protect the users


2. Therefore within group plans, people always want to know who they are interacting with. We should assume that some group plans may have acquaintances or friends of a friend or just people with things in common.  Therefore it is vitally important that the users can be displayed. We have a pre-existing page type for this in the lounge where we can see users, so we can clone and repurpose and use in the plans too. 


3. I hope when the functionality of the plan is done, the rule should work that only those in a group will have their comments visible to members in the group only. A plan is created by invitation or users asking to join? Therefore the owner can accept or reject users. If that's the case we shouldn't have random people you haven't accepted being able to see the comments in the plan.


4. At my last review, i could see Nigelâ€™s comments even though he wasnt a member of the lounge or the group. And in the plan details I am seeing three other names, so we must have a logic and cleans this up.
