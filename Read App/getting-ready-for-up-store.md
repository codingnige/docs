# Getting ready for App Store


You can't have multiple apps with the same app id. Google Play Store allows multiple apps to have same app name as long as they have a different app id. 

iOS requires both app id and app name (but not display name) to be unique from other apps in the store.

## Submitting to App Store

This is a three stage process:



### Provisioning Profile

```
a. Identity

b. Permissions

```

Each App has to be tied back to:

- A known Developer

- Installed on a known device

- Have right permissions for sytems and services


### App Store Connect

This is the website where you submit and manage your app in the App Store. In App Sore conect, you can manage your listings where you can:

- Check on Analytics

- Sales

- Financial reports

- Banking information on payment

### xCode

Ones you finish building and testing your app in xCode, you create an archive of the app. This is a bundle or package that contains your code and other dependency resources you submit to the App Connect Website.
