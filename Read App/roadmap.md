## April ending

Expectation : The MVP, for  April  will be fully functional and Styled with  the following features:

``` 

1. Sign up, Login, Forget

2. On-boarding

3. Dashboard

4. Profile, with image upload

5. Friends

6. Library

7. Reader / Comments

8. Discover

9. Finishing Design Style Guide

10. Group Plans (List, Activity.Details)

11. Chat

```

By the end of  next week we should have everything ready in Group Plans. We also should have the design and styles according to Stano's design mockups.

Additionally we will fix/implement a few requests and tweaks that will follow from the Segmentation in user testing: like fixed number of stats badges in library dashboard, remove Delete button from friends, optimise the description width, and font settings.

I will also encourage the use of the bug list page to facilitate the registration of bugs with captured shots -   https://www.notion.so/Bugs-390a315a553c475bb7a505154ccb803a


## May

1. The first week of May we are going to spend on Stripe integration and intensive bug fixing.  The lounges are interconnected with group plans, and  group plans was moved in the timeline because of them. This had an impact on other milestones. By four days.

2. Lounge Phase A will be delivered in 10 days when work starts. 

3. The list of lounges. Joined/Find More (All)

4. The details page of a lounge

5. The styles for collage in the middle of the lounge details page ( Image part of the collage. The rest will be non-functional.) 

6. The list of plans on the details page of a lounge

7. Joining a public lounge (Join-button)

8. Enhance existing Reader Capability for News, Blogs and  Comedy


## To be Agreed

1. Lounge Phase B

2. Projection is also to have linked Account and Parental Verification implemented.

I have completed  the architecture of the Parental Verification which is documented here - https://github.com/ReadAppLounge/docs/blob/master/Read%20App/Security.md  under Child Safety Section.



## June

We will enter into a lean and support role with our external clients on delivery of features, re-factoring and re-design of certain areas of the applications that business will identify in line with our strategic vision. This will minimise our costs and cash flow for active development. 

There will also be provision to extend the scope of the pool of our resources and manpower as will be required by business.
